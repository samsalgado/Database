The resin or sap is a storehouse of phytochemicals including proanthocyanidins (antioxidants), simple phenols, diterpenes, phytosterols, and biologically active alkaloids and lignans Scientists have attributed many of the biologically active properties of the sap (especially its wound-healing capacity) to two main active constituents- taspine and dimethylcedrusine.Taspine has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antiviral actions, and to be active against the herpes virus[ 318 ]. The lignan 'dimethylcedrusine' has been shown to play a central role in the resin's effective wound-healing action. The study revealed that the crude resin stimulated the contraction of wounds, helped in the formation of a crust/scab at the wound site, regenerated skin more rapidly, and assisted in the formation of new collagen[ 318 ]. Other phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds, proanthocyanidins, and diterpenes, have shown potent antibacterial activity (against E. Coli and Bacillus subtilis) as well as wound-healing properties[ 318 ]. Research has shown that the resin is a potent, cost-effective treatment for gastrointestinal ulcers and distress via antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and sensory afferent-dependent actions[ 318 ]. The resin has also shown an in vitro effect against stomach cancer and colon cancer cells[ 318 ]. It inhibits the growth of a human myelogenous leukaemia cell line and also prevents cells from mutating in test tube studies[ 318 ].

The seed, or the essential oil obtained from the seed and flowering stem is used for this, though all parts of the plant are used medicinally. The plant, especially the essential oil, is toxic in larger doses and so should be used with care and preferably under the direction of a skilled practitioner[ 21 , 238 ]. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women[ 238 ]. See also the notes above on toxicity. Until fairly recently, this was one of the most commonly used vermifuges, though it has now been largely replaced by synthetic drugs[ 222 ]. The seed, or the essential oil, was used[ 213 ]. It is very effective against most parasites, including the amoeba that causes dysentery, but is less effective against tapeworm[ 213 , 238 ]. Fasting should not precede its use and there have occasionally been cases of poisoning caused by this treatment[ 213 ]. The essential oil is used externally to treat athlete's foot and insect bites[ 238 , 240 ]. This is at its highest concentration in the flowering stems before seed is set, these contain around 0.7% essential oil of which almost 50% is the active vermifuge ascaridol[ 240 ]. The essential oil is of similar quality from plants cultivated in warm climates and those in cool climates[ 240 ]. The whole plant is analgesic, antiasthmatic, carminative, febrifuge, stomachic and vermifuge[ 1 , 4 , 21 , 57 , 145 , 147 , 171 ]. An infusion can be used as a digestive remedy, being taken to settle a wide range of problems such colic, diarrhoea and stomach pains; it is also used to treat conditions such as coughs, fevers and internal haemorrhages[ 254 , 348 ]. The leaves are added in small quantities as a flavouring for various cooked bean dishes because their carminative activity can reduce flatulence[ 222 ]. Externally, it has been used as a wash for haemorrhoids, as a poultice to detoxify snake bites and other poisons and is thought to have wound-healing properties[ 254 ]. The macerated leaves and flowers are mixed with a pinch of salt, and used as a poultice for treating persistent sores[ 348 ]. The essential oil is high in ascaridol, a nematicidal terpene peroxide which is active against ascaris, worms and ankylostomes[ 348 ].",

The steroids and saponins are found in higher quantities in the root, while the leaves have the greatest amount of glycosides. The plant also has been found to contain a large proportion of bitter properties, which were thought to contribute to its ability to stimulate digestion[318 ]. Solanidine and solasodine were discovered in the leaves and fruit, which probably accounts for its liver-protective properties[318 ]. The compound solanin, also found in the plant, has been documented in clinical research to possess analgesic activity (possibly through its ability to block pain impulses in the nervous system)[318 ]. One study has shown that the root, stem, flower, leaf, and fruit of the plant have anti-ulcer activity[318 ]. The plant also has been documented to have cardiotonic activity, possibly due to the alkaloid solanidine, which has been documented to have this activity[318 ]. The leaves and roots are used as a tonic and for treating fevers, anaemia, erysipelas, hepatitis, liver and spleen disorders, uterine tumours, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic gastritis, and other such digestive problems as sluggish digestion, bloating, and flatulence.

The plant is said to have 100 medicinal uses[214 ]. The roots and bark are taken orally either powdered or as infusions for treating chest complaints, headache, inflammation, abortion, ritual suicide, tuberculosis, infertility problems, venereal diseases and for constipation[295 ]. Toothache can also be relieved by chewing the roots[295 ]. Mixed roots of the violet tree and dwarf custard apple are used to treat gonorrhoea. Powdered roots or wood scrapings are used to treat headache by rubbing them on the forehead, while infusions from the roots are used to wash tropical ulcer[295 ]s. In Limpopo, the vhaVenda people use roots for mental disorders and as protection against children's illness during breastfeeding[295 ]. It is also believed that many African people use the powdered violet tree roots as a sexual boost for men[295 ]. The vhaVenda people mix the powdered root with mageu (maize or sorghum beverage) and it is given to a man to drink if he is sexually weak. In Zimbabwe, the roots are used to treat people who are believed to be possessed by evil spirits, for snakebite as well as for coughs when pounded with water and salt[295 ].",

The fruit pulp and leaves are rich in anthraquinone derivatives (around 2%), and glycosides, which are responsible for the laxative properties[ 299 ]. The fruit pulp is rich in pectins and mucilage[ 299 ]. In-vitro and in-vivo tests have shown that the seed powder has amoebicidal and cysticidal properties against Entamoeba histolytica and that it could cure intestinal amoebiasis of humans. The aqueous fraction of the pods has produced a significant decrease in glycaemia[ 299 ]. Aqueous and methanolic bark extracts have shown significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities[ 299 ]. An alcohol extract of the leaves has shown antibacterial activity in vivo against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus accelerated wound healing[ 299 ]. A water extract of the leaves has shown antifungal activity against the human skin pathogens Trichophyton spp., Epidermatophyton floccosum and Microsporum ferruginum[ 299 ]. The pods are used as a remedy for malaria, blood poisoning, anthrax, diabetes and dysentery[ 299 ]. The pods contain a sweet, sticky pulp[ 307 ]. A decoction of this is taken as a cure for kidney stones, as a vermifuge and as a laxative[ 299 ]. The pulp is extracted from the pods by bruising them and then boiling them in water, after which the decoction is evaporated.

The plant also has antiviral effects, particularly against influenza[238]. The stems are a pungent, bitter, warm herb that dilates the bronchial vessels whilst stimulating the heart and central nervous system[238]. The stems are also antidote, diaphoretic. diuretic, vasoconstrictor and vasodilator[176, 238]. They are used internally in the treatment of asthma, hay fever and allergic complaints[238]. They are also combined with a number of other herbs and used in treating a wide range of complaints238]. This herb should be used with great caution, preferably under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. It should not be prescribed to patients who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or suffering from high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism or glaucoma[238]. Ephedrine is seen as a performance-boosting herb and, as such, is a forbidden substance in many sporting events such as athletics[K]. The stems can be harvested at any time of the year and are dried for later use[238]. The root is antihydrotic, it lowers blood pressure and dilates the peripheral blood vessels[176].

            medProperites:"The root contains `filicin`, a substance that paralyses tapeworms and other internal parasites and has been used as a worm expellent[4, 172, 238]. It is one of the most effective treatments known for tapeworms - its use should be immediately followed by a non-oily purgative such as magnesium sulphate in order to expel the worms from the body[238]. An oily purge, such as caster oil, increases the absorption of the fern root and can be dangerous[238]. The root is harvested in the autumn and can be dried for later use, it should not be stored for longer than 12 months[238]. This remedy should be used with caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[238]. The root is toxic and the dosage is critical[238]. See also the notes above on toxicity. The root is also used in the treatment of dandruff[4, 172].",

            medProperites:"The yew tree is a highly toxic plant that has occasionally been used medicinally, mainly in the treatment of chest complaints. Modern research has shown that the plants contain the substance 'taxol' in their shoots. Taxol has shown exciting potential as an anti-cancer drug, particularly in the treatment of ovarian cancers[238]. Unfortunately, the concentrations of taxol in this species are too low to be of much value commercially, though it is being used for research purposes[238]. This remedy should be used with great caution and only under the supervision of a qualified practitioner[21]. See also the notes above on toxicity. All parts of the plant, except the fleshy fruit, are antispasmodic, cardiotonic, diaphoretic, emmenagogue, expectorant, narcotic and purgative[7, 21]. The leaves have been used internally in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, hiccup, indigestion, rheumatism and epilepsy[240, 257]. Externally, the leaves have been used in a steam bath as a treatment for rheumatism[257]. A homeopathic remedy is made from the young shoots and the berries[4]. It is used in the treatment of many diseases including cystitis, eruptions, headaches, heart and kidney problems, rheumatism etc[4]. Ingestion of 50-100g of needles can cause death.",

Its main active substances are steroidal saponins, including bacosides[ 254 ]. The whole plant is used - roots, stems and leaves[ 304 ]. It is cardiac, nervine tonic, sedative and vasoconstrictor[ 304 ]. The leaves and stalks are aperient and diuretic[ 304 ]. An alcohol extract of the whole plant has been shown to have anticancer activity against Walker carcinoma[ 304 ]. An alcohol extract of plant is a muscle relaxant and cardiovascular relaxant[ 348 ]. Research in India suggests that brahmi improves mental function, memory and concentration, and also reduces learning time[ 254 ]. The plant contains the alkaloid brahmine, which has been shown to raise blood pressure when administered in therapeutic dosage, but to be hypotensive when given in very strong dosage[ 348 ]. A tranquilizing saponin that resembles reserpine is also present[ 348 ]. The plant is used principally in the treatment of a range of nervous system disorders including neuralgia, hysteria, epilepsy, insanity, neurasthenia, aphonia and hoarseness[ 254 , 304 ]. The plant is also taken internally in a number of other conditions including indigestion, ulcers, wind, constipation, asthma, bronchitis and infertility[ 254 ]. A poultice made of the boiled plant is applied to the chests of children in the treatment of acute bronchitis and other coughs[ 304 ]. A juice made from the plant is applied as a wash on burns[ 272 ].",
